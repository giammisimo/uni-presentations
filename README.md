# uni-presentations
This repository is an archive of all of my presentation I made during my Bachelors and Masters Degree @ Universit√† degli Studi di Parma.
The presentations are written either in Italian or English, the language will be noted as a prefix to the single presentations.
The courses are reported with their original name.

Obviously, the presentations depth and size will vary significantly based on the course and the exam (time) requirements.
